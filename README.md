PaymentKit-Droid
================

PaymentKit-Droid is an Open Source Android library that allows developers to create sleek payment forms like those made
popular by StubHub, Stripe, Uber, and Postmates.

The PKExample provides an example implementation pattern you may follow.

The 'PaymentKit Droid' folder is the library project you want to add to
your Android project. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8248196/how-to-add-a-library-project-to-a-android-project.

A sample app will soon be available on the google play store.
